# Linduino Read Me
## Overview ##
The Linduino (Demonstration Circuit DC2026) is an Arduino-based controller board used for developing and distributing firmware libraries and example code for Analog Devices products. As shipped, the Linduino functions as a bridge between evaluation GUI software and supported product evaluation boards. It can also be reprogrammed with product-specific example code, included in the Linduino Github repository.

Each Linduino-supported product includes an example main program, defined in the LTSketchbook/Part Number folder. Driver code is defined in the LTSketchbook/libraries folder, and is intended to be used directly in the customer's platform.
